/**
 * Parse links from string.
 * @param {string} str - The string to parse.
 * @param {User|string} renderer - The user we're rendering these links for, or
 *   the string `Loremaster` for a loremaster, or the string `Anonymous` for an
 *   anonymous user.
 * @returns {Promise<{str: string, links: object}>} - A Promise that resolves
 *   with an object with two properties: `str`, which provides the updated
 *   version of the original string with all links within it parsed out, and
 *   `links`, which is an array of objects providing information about the
 *   links that were rendered. Each of the objects in this array has the
 *   following properties:
 *     `page`    Either the Page document that was being linked to, or `null`
 *               if no Page could be found that matched the link.
 *     `title`   The title of the Page document being linked to, or the text
 *               of the link if no Page could be found. This is an appropriate
 *               value for a link's `title` property.
 *     `text`    The text of the link, which could be the same as the title, or
 *               an alias parsed from the link.
 *     `secret`  If the link appears inside of a secret, this property provides
 *               the codename of that secret. If not, this is `null`.
